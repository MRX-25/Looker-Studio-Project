### Healthcare business Data Analysis

### Exploring and Cleaning Data:

### Exploration:
i just connect the dataset from a software to Google Sheet. Explore the structure of the data, check for any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.

### Data Cleaning: 
Clean the data by addressing missing values, date, correcting errors, and standardizing formats. For example:

Check for missing values in each column and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).
Standardize naming conventions and formats across columns (e.g., ensuring consistency in hospital names, radiologist names).
Remove duplicates if any.
Data Transformation: Perform  necessary data transformations to prepare the data for analysis. For example:

Convert categorical variables into numerical representations .
Parse dates if applicable.
Aggregate or summarize data as needed (e.g., summing data quantities for each hospital).

### KPI:
Total Hospital, Total Working Data, Total Radiologist, Total Modality, Avg Work per day

### Question About This Data


### Top 20 Hospitals by Work Quantity:
Which are the top 20 hospitals based on work quantity?
What is the work quantity distribution among different hospitals?

### Weekly Overview by Radiologist:
What is the weekly overview for each radiologist?
How does the work quantity vary throughout the weekdays for radiologists?

### Modality Overview:
What is the work quantity distribution for different modalities (ECG, MR, CT, CR)?
Which modality has the highest work quantity?

### Top 10 Radiologists by Work Quantity:
Who are the top 10 radiologists based on work quantity?
What is the work quantity distribution among these top radiologists?

### Top Modality by Work Quantity:
Which modality has the highest work quantity across all hospitals?
How does the work quantity for each modality vary among different hospitals?

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes information on various medical procedures conducted at different hospitals. Here's a brief summary of the key details

### 1. Patient Information
    Patient Names, Medical Record Numbers (MRN)
### 2. Procedure and Modality Information
    Procedures, Modalities
### 3. Radiologist Details
    Radiologist Name -> Dr. XYZ
### 4. Hospital Information
    Hospital Name
### 5. Report Completion Time
    Ranges from 12/1/23 22:52 to 12/1/23 23:01
### 6. Study Descriptions
    HAND CHEST LUMBER SPINE KNEE JOINT



### Observations and Considerations:
    Radiologist Workload
    Hospital Diversity
    Modality Usage
    Procedure Variability
    Data Completeness

### Conclusion
    The dataset's key focus is on radiologist workload, hospital variability, and modality usage. Recommendations include a thorough data quality check, in-depth analysis of the radiologist's performance, and optimization of procedures and modalities for resource allocation. This overview lays the foundation for detailed analysis and decision-making in healthcare management


### Top Procedures:

Most frequent procedures include "Chest PA," "Knee Joint," "Lumber Spine B/V," and "CT Brain."
"Chest PA" is the most common procedure performed.

### Radiologist Performance:

Dr. Pratul Kumar Sarker appears to be the primary radiologist, involved in various procedures across multiple hospitals.
Prof. Dr. Md. Mobarak Ali is also active, particularly in procedures related to the spine and neck.

### Hospital Utilization:

Unicorn Healthcare Solution Ltd and Radium Hospital are heavily utilized for different procedures.
Specific hospitals like BMC Tajman Hospital Ukhiya and BMC Shifa Diagnostic Center, Dinajpur, are also included.

### Modality Distribution:

"CR" (Computed Radiography) is the predominant modality used across procedures.
"CT" (Computed Tomography) is also commonly employed, especially for brain-related studies.
"ECG" (Electrocardiography) is also commonly employed Heart studies and 
"MRI" (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is also commonly employed for L/S , D/S, neck, MRCP studies.

### Patient Demographics:

Patients of various age groups, including adults and children, are represented in the dataset.
Common studies involve Hand, Chest, Knee, and Brain imaging.

### Billing Information:

Billing information is available, indicating involvement with "Bill of UHS" and "CT Unknown" procedures.

### Study Descriptions:

Various study descriptions include specific body parts like Hand, Chest, Knee, and different imaging perspectives like Lateral View and Plain.

### Time Analysis:

Procedures are timestamped, allowing for temporal analysis.
Report completion avg times range 10 Minutes
